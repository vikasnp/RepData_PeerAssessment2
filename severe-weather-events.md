Most Severe Weather Events Impacting Health and Economy
=======================================================

## Synopsis

In this report we try to answer some basic questions about severe weather
events.  Specifically, we try to identify which types of events are the most
harmful to population health and the most deleterious to the economy.
To answer these questions, we obtained the storm database from the
U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA).  This database
tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States,
including estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property and crop damage.
From these data, we found that tornadoes and heat are the severe weather
event types by far most dangerous to people, while flooding, hurricanes, and storm
surges are the most costly event types to the economy.  Interestingly, only
flooding is one of the top three most dangerous or most costly event types.

## Data Processing





```r
library(R.utils)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(quantmod)
```


### Getting and Loading the Data

From the Coursera "Reproducible Research" course
[file repository](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2),
we obtain the storm data in bzip archive format and extract it.

```{ r download.data,cache=T,eval=F}
download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", destfile="repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2")

bunzip2("repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2", overwrite=T, remove=F)
```

We read in the extracted file, which is in CSV format, into a data frame, which we
then convert to a data.table for efficiency of later operations.


```r
storm = read.csv("repdata-data-StormData.csv")
# storm = read.csv('slice.csv')
storm = data.table(storm)
```


We check the first few rows in the dataset, which should have 902297 rows in total.


```r
dim(storm)
```

```
## [1] 902297     37

```r
head(storm, n = 3)

### Restricting to recent years

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

One concern is that there may be an inconsistence balance of event types
recorded over the years.  For example, maybe in the earlier years, deaths due
to rip currents were not recorded.  To allow for more fair comparisons,
we want to restrict our analysis to years that demonstrate a large number of
recorded events, as this may indicate better record-keeping.

So we count the number of events per year.


```r
storm$year = as.numeric(format(as.Date(storm$BGN_DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"), 
    "%Y"))

stormsByYear = storm[, lapply(.SD, length), by = year, .SDcols = 1]
setnames(stormsByYear, 2, "count")

# ggplot(stormsByYear) + geom_line(aes(year, count))
```


From a plot, we see that the number of events tracked starts to significantly pick up around 1995.
So we restrict the dataset to those recent events, in the hope that we get a more
consistent balance of event types across recent years.


```r
storm = storm[year >= 1995]
dim(storm)
```

```
## [1] 681500     38
```



### Computing damage values

We convert the property damage and crop damage data into comparable numerical form,
based on the meaning of units described in the code book (National Climatic Data Center's
[record layout document](http://ire.org/media/uploads/files/datalibrary/samplefiles/Storm%20Events/layout08.doc),
which is referenced on the
[Investigative Reporers & Editors](http://ire.org/nicar/database-library/databases/storm-events/)
web site.)


```r
storm$PROPDMGEXP = as.character(storm$PROPDMGEXP)
storm$PROPDMGEXP[toupper(storm$PROPDMGEXP) == "B"] = "9"
storm$PROPDMGEXP[toupper(storm$PROPDMGEXP) == "M"] = "6"
storm$PROPDMGEXP[toupper(storm$PROPDMGEXP) == "K"] = "3"
storm$PROPDMGEXP[toupper(storm$PROPDMGEXP) == "H"] = "2"
storm$PROPDMGEXP = as.numeric(storm$PROPDMGEXP)
storm$PROPDMGEXP[is.na(storm$PROPDMGEXP)] = 0
storm$PropertyDamage = storm$PROPDMG * 10^storm$PROPDMGEXP
summary(storm$PropertyDamage)
```

```
##      Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.      Max. 
## 0.000e+00 0.000e+00 0.000e+00 5.539e+05 1.500e+03 1.150e+11
```




```r
storm$CROPDMGEXP = as.character(storm$CROPDMGEXP)
storm$CROPDMGEXP[toupper(storm$CROPDMGEXP) == "B"] = "9"
storm$CROPDMGEXP[toupper(storm$CROPDMGEXP) == "M"] = "6"
storm$CROPDMGEXP[toupper(storm$CROPDMGEXP) == "K"] = "3"
storm$CROPDMGEXP[toupper(storm$CROPDMGEXP) == "H"] = "2"
storm$CROPDMGEXP[toupper(storm$CROPDMGEXP) == ""] = "0"
storm$CROPDMGEXP = as.numeric(storm$CROPDMGEXP)
storm$CROPDMGEXP[is.na(storm$CROPDMGEXP)] = 0
storm$CropDamage = storm$CROPDMG * 10^storm$CROPDMGEXP
summary(storm$CropDamage)
```

```
##      Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.      Max. 
## 0.000e+00 0.000e+00 0.000e+00 5.531e+04 0.000e+00 1.510e+09
```


We consider both property and crop damage as important components of the
economic impact of weather events.  So we sum them up, even though property
damage figures dominates those for crop damage.


```r
storm$TotalDamage = storm$PropertyDamage + storm$CropDamage
summary(storm$TotalDamage)
```

```
##      Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.      Max. 
## 0.000e+00 0.000e+00 0.000e+00 6.092e+05 2.000e+03 1.150e+11
```





#### Adjusting for inflation

We adjust for inflation using the Consumer Price Index.


```r
invisible(getSymbols("CPIAUCSL", src = "FRED"))
yearlyCPI = apply.yearly(CPIAUCSL, mean)
yearlyCPI.in2011Dollars = as.numeric(yearlyCPI["2011"])/yearlyCPI
cpiAdj = as.data.frame(yearlyCPI.in2011Dollars)
cpiAdj$year = as.numeric(format(as.Date(rownames(cpiAdj)), "%Y"))
colnames(cpiAdj)[1] = "CPIConv"
head(cpiAdj, n = 3)
```

```
##              CPIConv year
## 1947-12-01 10.072330 1947
## 1948-12-01  9.354623 1948
## 1949-12-01  9.447282 1949
```

```r

storm = merge(storm, cpiAdj, by = "year")
storm$TotalDamage = storm$TotalDamage * storm$CPIConv
```


### Cleaning up most relevant event types

Since the event types in the data are inconsistently named, we manually
merge a few event types.  Since there are close to 1000 different levels in the
event type factor and it would be too time-consuming to process them all,
we focus on about 80 of the most significant event types.  This focus should not affect
our analysis as we are seeking to identify only the most impactful event types.
Event types are considered significant if they have high total damage.

For example, in the list below, we should combine "HURRICANE OPAL",
"HURRICANE" and "HURRICANE/TYPHOON".


```r
tail(sort(tapply(storm$TotalDamage, storm$EVTYPE, sum)), n = 20)
```

We also look at about 80 of the most significant event types with respect to injuries and
fatalities and again merge the terms that represent the same type of event.

## Results

When we analyze the data, we look at total numbers in aggregate.
We don't look at yearly averages because there are many
significant events that happen only once every few years, for example massive
hurricanes and floods.

### Dangerous Event Types

We look at the number of people killed or hurt per event type, for the
50 most dangerous event types:


```r
dangerous = as.data.frame.table(tail(sort(tapply(storm$TotalPeople, storm$EVTYPE, 
    sum)), n = 50))
colnames(dangerous) = c("EventType", "TotalPeople")
p1 = ggplot(data = dangerous, aes(x = EventType, y = TotalPeople)) + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 
    1, -0.2, 0.91), "cm")) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(x = "", y = "# People Killed/Injured")
p2 = p1 + scale_y_log10() + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(-0.2, 1, 1, 1), "cm")) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) + labs(y = expression(paste("(", 
    log[10], ")"))) + xlab("Type of Severe Weather Event")
p1 = p1 + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2, main = "Most Dangerous Event Types")
```

![plot of chunk plot.dangerous.event.types](figure/plot_dangerous_event_types.png) 


We can see from the skew of the graph that certain event types are the most
dangerous to the health of the population, most notably tornadoes and heat.
In fact, we have to also plot in
logarithmic scale in order to be able to compare the less dangerous event types.

### Costly Event Types

We now look at total property and crop damage per event type, for the 50
most costly event types.


```r
ruinous = as.data.frame.table(tail(sort(tapply(storm$TotalDamage, storm$EVTYPE, 
    sum)), n = 50))
colnames(ruinous) = c("EventType", "TotalDamage")
p1 = ggplot(data = ruinous, aes(x = EventType, y = TotalDamage)) + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 
    1, -0.2, 0.82), "cm")) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(x = "", y = "Property/Crop Damage (USD)")
p2 = p1 + scale_y_log10() + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(-0.2, 1, 1, 1), "cm")) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) + labs(y = expression(paste("(", 
    log[10], "USD)"))) + xlab("Type of Severe Weather Event")
p1 = p1 + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2, main = "Most Costly Event Types")
```

![plot of chunk plot.costly.event.types](figure/plot_costly_event_types.png) 


As with dangerous event types, we can see from the skew of the graph that
certain event types are
disproportionately costly to the economy, most notably flood, hurricane, and storm
surge.  Once again, we have to also plot in
logarithmic scale in order to be able to compare the less costly event types.

### Dangerous & Costly Event Types

We also want to look at which event types are harmful both for people and property.

We narrow down to the top 10 in each dimension.


```r
dangerous10 = tail(sort(tapply(storm$TotalPeople, storm$EVTYPE, sum)), n = 10)
ruinous10 = tail(sort(tapply(storm$TotalDamage, storm$EVTYPE, sum)), n = 10)
impactfulEvTypes = unique(c(names(ruinous10), names(dangerous10)))
```


We can now see which event types are particularly dangerous or particularly
costy or both.
  

```r
# Using dplyr
impact = storm %.% group_by(EVTYPE) %.% summarize(TotalDamage = sum(TotalDamage), 
    TotalPeople = sum(TotalPeople))
impact[!(impact$EVTYPE %in% impactfulEvTypes), "EVTYPE"] = ""
ggplot(impact) + aes(y = TotalPeople, x = TotalDamage, label = EVTYPE) + geom_point() + 
    ggtitle("Dangerous & Costly Event Types") + labs(y = expression(paste("# People Killed/Injured")), 
    x = expression(paste("Property/Crop damage (USD)"))) + geom_text(angle = 45, 
    vjust = 0, hjust = 0, size = 3) + ylim(0, 25000)
```

![plot of chunk plot.ruinous.vs.dangerous](figure/plot_ruinous_vs_dangerous.png) 


From this plot, we can see that the most impactful event types are either
very dangerous to the population or very costly, but generally not at the same time.
For example, heat injures and kills many people but is not particularly costly.
Similarly, storm surge is costly but is relatively harmless to people.

Tornadoes are the most dangerous to people but storm surges, hurricanes,
and floods are most costly.  Also, flooding is the most costly, but heat
and tornadoes injure or kill more people.

```
